      <p>
        When you here about climate change you might think it just refers to tempertaures increaseing.<br>
        But it effects every single part of our society.<br>
        Rise in temperatures can lead to change of wheather patterns, rise of sea levels, and much more.<br>
        These changes can reduce the amount of crops that are produced, flooding can damage ecosystems and
        infrastructure, and temperature changes can increases diseases spread.<br>
        You might think that these issues shouldn't concern you and you'll only have to worry about them in the
        future.<br>
        But climate change will only get worse as time progress<br>

      <p>
        In about 6-11 years, scientist have concluded that Earths temperture will rise by 1.5 degrees celcius(2.7F), in
        30 years it will rise by 2.0 degrees celcius(3.6F), and in 43 temperatures wil increase by 3.0 degrees
        celcius(5.4F)<br>
        These temperatures changes can have a drastic impact on the enviorments on earth and on ourselves.

      <p>
        One of the main ways that you can fight climate change is to find ways to reduce energy consumption.<br>
        Some examples are to use your car less, and remebering to turn your lights off.<br>
        Another way to fight climate change is to switch your energy supplier with a solar power company and limit the
        amount of times you order something online.
